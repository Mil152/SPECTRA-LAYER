# SPECTRA-LAYER: Spectral Prediction through Encoded Computational Transformer for Reflective and Absorptive Layer Evaluation

## Overview
SPECTRA-LAYER is an innovative deep learning framework designed to predict the transmission (T) and reflection (R) spectra of layered material structures across a broad range of wavelengths, including visible, infrared (IR), and radio frequency (RF) spectrums. Leveraging the Transformer architecture, SPECTRA-LAYER utilizes a dataset generated by the custom-developed TMM package, LayerLumos, offering fast and accurate surrogate simulations of optical properties for diverse multilayer thin film arrangements.

## Features
- **Broad Spectrum Analysis**: Supports predictions across visible, IR, and RF ranges, enabling a wide application scope.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes a sophisticated Transformer-based model trained on high-quality data from LayerLumos for precise spectral predictions.
- **Universal Application**: Capable of simulating a vast array of multilayer structures with various materials and thicknesses.
- **Fast Simulation Times**: Offers a significant speedup compared to traditional physical simulation methods.

## Installation

To get started with SPECTRA-LAYER, follow these installation steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithub/spectra-layer.git
cd spectra-layer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed, along with any other prerequisites mentioned in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

To use SPECTRA-LAYER for predicting the optical spectra of a given multilayer structure, follow the instructions below:

```python
from spectra_layer import SpectraPredictor

# Define your layer structure (example)
layers = [
    {'material': 'SiO2', 'thickness': 100},  # Thickness in nm
    {'material': 'TiO2', 'thickness': 50},
    # Add more layers as needed
]

# Initialize the predictor
predictor = SpectraPredictor()

# Predict the spectra
transmission, reflection = predictor.predict(layers)

# Results are now stored in `transmission` and `reflection`
```
